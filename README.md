# Graph-Visualizer
Web application to create graphs and visualize algorithms on them

[demo](https://sanbornpnguyen.github.io/Graph-Visualizer/)

## Tutorial
* Click the add vertex button to add a new vertex
* Double click two vertices to add an edge between them
  * Simple graphs only so no loops or multiple edges between vertices
* Click an edge to delete it
* Right click a vertex to delete it

## Todo

### Functionality
* Rewrite edge deletion using isEdge
* Weighted edges
* Algorithms
  * BFS
  * DFS
  * Dijkstra
  * Eulerian Tours/Trails
  * Hamiltonian Paths/Cycles (O(n!))
* Pretty it up

### In code
* Put things in their own file
* Organize vertices, edges into an array of classes
